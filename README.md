# AttysScope (Windows/Linux)

Plotting program for the Attys for Windows/Linux

https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys_scope

## Features

* Records from multiple Attys at the same time. For example, you can attach two Attys to both the upper and lower arm to measure muscle activity, acceleration and orientation. Tested BT dongles which work with more than one Attys: ASUS-BT400 and Belkin (Broadcom chipset).
* Realtime add ons in Python to visualise data or feed the data into your favourite game engine (via UDP broadcast).
* Saves data as tab separated values which can be directly imported into Python, MATLAB â„¢, OCTAVE, R, GNUPLOT and many other software packages.
* Change the gain, highpass, lowpass, 50/60Hz bandstop and rectifier for amplitude plots
* Compiles under Windows and Linux (QT5)

The screenshot above shows attys_scope in action under Windows where it feeds to the data into a Python program
which then plots a bar graph in realtime.

## Requires
* QT5
* IIR1 libaray (http://www.berndporr.me.uk/iir/)
* AttysComm (https://github.com/glasgowneuro/AttysComm)

## Compile under Windows
* Install: Visual Studio 2017 community edition
* clone iir1 in your root directory: https://github.com/berndporr/iir1 and compile it (release version)
* Download the open source version of QT5, 64 bits for visual C++ 2015/2017 from www.qt.io:
  https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.0/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015_64-5.7.0.exe
* git clone https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys_scope.git 
* git clone https://github.com/glasgowneuro/AttysComm.git
* "qmake -tp vc" and then re-target the project (right click on attys_scope in the Solutions Explorer -> Retarget Projects)
* Open the .sln file
* You might need to add the iir_static.lib to the project
* Build solution

## Compile under Linux
* git clone https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys_scope.git 
* git clone https://github.com/glasgowneuro/AttysComm.git
* Install the IIR filter library https://github.com/berndporr/iir1 or install it via ppa: "ppa:berndporr/usbdux" and  "apt-get install iir1-dev".
* Install the other packages: "apt-get install qt5-qmake, g++, qtbase5-dev-tools, qtdeclarative5-dev-tools, libbluetooth-dev, qtbase5-dev, qt5-default"
* cd attys_scope
* qmake
* make
* make install
* Start by typing "attysscope"

## Post- and realtime processing in Python
Check out the python subdirectory. This contains scripts for both postprocessing of datafiles and realtime processing.

## UNREAL gaming engine
The unreal subdirectory contains a class which receives UDP packets from attysscope and also screenshots of the blueprints for both a jumping and driving game
